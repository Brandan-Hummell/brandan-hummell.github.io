# Using C# and Unity to Create a Classic

For this project, I was the game designer and developer (though I definitely used a lot of tutorials along the way). Galactic Invaders is a space shooter that I made in honor of of the classics like Galaga and Space Invaders. The game features unlimited levels that progress in difficulty and a score system. This was my first project using C# and Unity! I had a blast making this game, and it can be found/played in the Galactic Invaders respository at my GitHib account.


## Galactic Invaders Features:

1. Unlimited levels with scaling difficulty
2. Scoring system
3. Player life tracker
4. An easily navigable main menu
5. A scaling interface


## Final Thoughts

Unity as a whole was a great way to learn game programming. The interface was intuitive, and I was able to learn some C# along the way. Many of the necessary components needed for game making were already part of the Unity engine (like collision detection), so I was able to focus on implementing the big picture agenda items.

One of the biggest challenges was implementing unlimited levels. I used one recurring scene for all of the levels, and this will make the game fairly repetitve in the long run. In terms of game design, I would love to create different types of enemy formations, ships, and firing patterns in order to keep the user engaged.

The next major additions to the game I would make is a pause menu and a high score system. The pause menu would allow the user to take a break, go back to the main menu, or quit the game directly. The high score system would not take too much to implement, but it is a staple to arcade style games. Nothing drives player motivation quite like competition.
