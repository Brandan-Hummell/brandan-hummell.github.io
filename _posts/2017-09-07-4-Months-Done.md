title: A Review of Bloc (33% Done)

# 10,000 Foot View

The overall experience has met and exceeded my expectations. I am constantly testing my limits, and I would have had a significantly harder time learning all of the material by myself. I am proud of two projects currently in my portfolio; not only do they represent my progression of knowledge, they are stepping stones in my goal to become a professional developer.

## My Coding Sherpa

Bloc lets you pick your mentor from long list with personal bios as well as their proficiencies, which was super helpful from a compatibility stand point. My mentor is fantastic. He answers questions but lets me struggle when it's beneficial to my growth. If I get stuck, he helps me understand the root of the issue. All in all, I am appreciative that I have someone to help catalyze my learning process.

## A Structured Journey

The people at Bloc put a lot of thought into the sequence and the content of the curriculum. The flow is pretty natural, and I haven't felt overwhelmed at any one point with completely new concepts.

Bloc's program is project based, which is totally the way to go. I am a learn-by-doing kind of person, so this works perfectly for me. Bloc does not follow an academic approach (thankfully) in which they teach you a ton of theory, and then you get some chances to put that theory into practice later. While they do provide some programming basics for anyone new to coding, mostly everything that I work on goes straight to the portfolio.

## Integrated Career Preparation

While I am not in the job-applying phase of the program, I can say that they interweave job workshop checkpoints throughout the curriculum to get people thinking about job prospects. I am a big fan of this approach. My mentor (and every other mentor I saw on the list) has been a professional developer for several years. In addition to advise from my mentor, Bloc has everyone set up a portfolio as a project. I can't emphasize enough how much I appreciate this aspect of Bloc, since my portfolio (as I surmised from coder friends) is one of the key elements in future job applications.


## Only the Beginning

Though I have 8 more months to go in Bloc, my current experiences have only made me more eager to work on increasingly complex and interesting problems. I know I am heading in the right direction. The next blog post will likely be another review towards the end of the program, in which I will break down and discuss the bootcamp in its entirety.
