title: Developing My Goal

## A Gamer's Beginning

Swinging the master sword in a green cap & tunic was part of my daily routine as a child. I would spend hours fighting through dungeons, pushing blocks, reflecting the occasional octorok projectile off my shield, and devising the best strategies to defeat the next boss. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was one of my favorite games growing up because I could explore, solve many intricate puzzles, and experience a mental challenge that few other activities (besides reading) could offer.

## The Natural Continuance

When I was about 9 or 10, my father signed me up for a computer class at the local community center. We learned about motherboards, CPUs, floppy drives, among various other parts. Our final test was to take an old computer apart, put it back together, and install Windows from the BIOS. Though the class was very basic, I gained a ton of insight into the inner workings of a computer, and, more importantly, I found a new interest that itched my insatiable curiosity.

## Redisovering a Path Forward

While I continued to learn about computers over the years (learning some visual basic, Python, and Java in high school), I unfortunately did not pursue programming into college. After I graduated and worked for some time as a paid search analyst, writing SQL queries and investigating Google Adwords scripts rekindled my interests, so I picked up a few books on Javascript/HTML/CSS. After quickly devouring the book's content, I found myself in a perplexing situation; my side projects at work were signifcantly more captivating than the main job responsibilities. It was at that time that I decided that I would do what it took to code for a living.

## My Next Step

I knew that changing my career path would be difficult, especially when trying to enter a technical field. There were many options to consider, but I ultimately decided that a coding bootcamp is the best option available. In my next couple of blog posts, I will talk about my decision to enroll into Bloc and my experiences in the program thus far.
