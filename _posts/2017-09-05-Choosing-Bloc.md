# A Pivotal Decision

After deciding that I wanted to pursue a career in web development, I needed to understand the options for achieving my goal.

## The Homegrown Developer

I could continue to teach myself as I had been doing for almost half a year before ultimately deciding to switch industries. There are many pros and cons to teaching yourself how to code. I knew that it was feasible, as I heard from my friends in the industry. Learning on your own is also almost completely free, which is a huge plus when I already have student loans to pay off.

Some of the main problems with this method is the lack of structure and the absence of guidance when you get stuck. Even though every developer needs to know how to teach themselves, I wanted to expedite the process as much as possible. Learning entirely on my own was not the optimal choice.


## Another College Degree

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I knew that I could potentially return to college and get a degree in computer science. While this would give me legitimate credentials to apply for web development jobs, there were more significant obstacles with this option. First and foremost were the time and money involved. I could not afford to spend another $40K or more on school, and I was already working a full time job, so the opportunity cost of going back to school for 2 more years would be substantial. After seriously thinking it through, I knew I needed to find a compromise between the two most obvious choices.


## Coding Trade School

It did not take long to find out about coding bootcamps. There were a plethora of seemingly well established companies promising a job upon completion of their curriculum. In the back of my mind, I was worried about getting scammed. None of these programs were accredited, and many job descriptions I looked up required a degree.

After doing more research and speaking with friends who were familiar with bootcamps, I decided that enrolling was worth the risk. They were significantly cheaper than college, and they took way less time because the curriculum is concentrated specifically on accruing the skills necessary for a job. Many bootcamps also had a job guarantee that reduced my financial risk. After settling on the idea of a bootcamp, I needed to find the right one.

## Meeting My Criteria

I had a full-time job, and I was looking for a way to keep working while breaking into the field of web development. This meant that I needed to find a part-time, online program. That narrowed down the search considerably. I specifically wanted a mentor, so that I could learn from someone who had been in the industry and had years of coding experience. On top of all of that, I did not want to pay an exorbitant amount of money, and the bootcamp needed a job guarantee (even though those promises have a ton of fine print). After discussing the various curriculums with a couple of people that I trust, I decided on Bloc as the best possible option for my situation. Bloc met all of my requirements, and I was eager to begin my foray into a new career.

## !(Leap of Faith)

Signing up for Bloc was a giant decision that involved several months of research and thought. Even though there was some risk involved, by the end of the process, I was confident that Bloc was the best move for my future endeavors. In my next blog post, I will talk about my experiences in Bloc now that I am roughly a third of the way through the program.
