Besides the coding and gaming that I talk about in my blog posts, I have a ton of hobbies and interests. I love to cook, work on my motorcycle, brew beer, play Magic the Gathering, and travel. All of the things I enjoy the most have more in common then they would initially seem. There is always an aspect of problem solving and deep learning. I cannot help but be drawn in by a good puzzle, and I often find myself travelling down the proverbial rabbit hole. Perhaps this is the reason why I love developing code; projects are problem solving opportunities rife with the chance to learn and create.
