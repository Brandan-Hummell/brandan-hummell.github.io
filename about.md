## A little about me

I have a BA in English and an MS in Commerce with a focus in Marketing and Management. After graduation I immediately entered the digital marketing industry as a paid search analyst. With over two years in the industry, I am currently an Account Manager working with many types of paid media. 


## Fun Stuff

My favorite game franchises include Final Fantasy, Castlevania, The Witcher, Zelda, and pretty much anything made by Bethesda. If it isn't already readily apparent, I mostly play RPGs, FPS, Puzzle/Adventure, and story-centric games. I am still a sucker for a good platformer though, as I still revisit Super Mario Bros on my SNES every now and then.
